# CSS

+ CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document, describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

## There are three Ways to Insert CSS in an HTML documment

+ External CSS

 With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

+ Internal CSS

An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the style element, inside the head section.

+ Inline CSS

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

## CSS selectors

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

+ All CSS Simple Selectors:
```
| Selector | Example | Description |
| :---        |    :----:   |      ---: |
| #id | #firstname | Selects the element with id="firstname" |
| .class	.intro	Selects all elements with class="intro" |
